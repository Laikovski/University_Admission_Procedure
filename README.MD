## Stage 1/7: No one is left behind!
    At this stage, your program should:

    - Take three inputs as integer numbers. They are the exam results.
    - Calculate the mean score of all three numbers. If the mean is a fractional number, don't discard the fractional part.
    - Print the resulting number.
    - Print the Congratulations, you are accepted! line.

## Stage 2/7: Raising the bar
    - At this stage, your program should:

    - Read the numbers and output the mean score, as in the previous stage.
    - If the mean score is equal to or greater than 60.0, output the following message: Congratulations, you are accepted!
    - If the mean score is less than 60.0, output the following message: We regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission.
