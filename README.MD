## Stage 1/7: No one is left behind!
    At this stage, your program should:

    - Take three inputs as integer numbers. They are the exam results.
    - Calculate the mean score of all three numbers. If the mean is a fractional number, don't discard the fractional part.
    - Print the resulting number.
    - Print the Congratulations, you are accepted! line.

## Stage 2/7: Raising the bar
    - At this stage, your program should:

    - Read the numbers and output the mean score, as in the previous stage.
    - If the mean score is equal to or greater than 60.0, output the following message: Congratulations, you are accepted!
    - If the mean score is less than 60.0, output the following message: We regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission.

## Stage 3/7: Going big 
    At this stage, your program should:

    - Read the first input, an N integer representing the total number of applicants.
    - Read the second input, an M integer representing the number of applicants that should be accepted to the university.
    - Read N lines from the input. Each line contains the first name, the last name, and the applicant's GPA. These values are separated by one whitespace character. A GPA is a floating-point number with two decimals.
    - Output the Successful applicants: message.
    - Output M lines for applicants with the top-ranking GPAs. Each line should contain the first and the last name of the applicant separated by a whitespace character. Successful applicants' names should be printed in descending order depending on the GPA â€” first, the applicant with the best GPA, then the second-best, and so on.
    - If two applicants have the same GPA, rank them in alphabetical order using their full names (we know it's not really fair to choose students by their names, but what choice do we have?)
